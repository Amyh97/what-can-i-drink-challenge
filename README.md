# This project was a challenge from Code Institute done for learning purposes
# What Can I Drink challenge. 

This is one of the two challenges set at the end of the "Test Driven Development u=Using Jasmine" challenge

## Challenge:
our challenge is to write some tests for the Drink About game.

Drink About is a simple function that will check the age and return a drink appropriate for your age. Create a function called whatCanIDrink. This function should take in age as parameter. The function should do the following:

    If the age is less than 0, then it should return "Sorry. I can’t tell what drink because that age is incorrect!"
    If the age is less than 14, then it should return "Drink Toddy"
    If the age is less than 18, then it should return "Drink Coke"
    If the age is less than 21, then it should return "Drink Beer"
    If the age is less than 130, then it should return "Drink Whisky"
    Else return "Sorry. I can’t tell what drink because that age is incorrect!"
